# GalaxyPPG-Logger

## Getting Started

Installing an app on the Galaxy Watch using just an APK file is restricted, and typically requires distribution through official channels such as the app store.
However, due to challenges in store distribution, please follow the steps below to install the app using **Android Studio**.

### Import Samsung Health Sensor SDK

Samsung Health Sensor SDK can be downloaded from the following link.
After downloading the AAR file, add it to your project under the `/wearable/libs` directory.

### Permission Control

To officially deploy and use this app with Samsung Health features, you must submit a partner request:
ðŸ‘‰ [Samsung Health Partner Application](https://developer.samsung.com/SHealth/partner/MzgxNjUw)

However, for development or trial use, this app leverages **Health Developer Mode**, allowing you to bypass the partner approval process. In the wearable app, go to Settings > Applications > Health Platform and tap the top area multiple times to enable [Dev mode].
